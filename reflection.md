- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For **House.java**:
    1. I decided to 'overload' the constructor so that without elevator information, it defaults to no elevator;
    2. I decided to 'overload' the moveIn method so that it accepts a student's name instead of a Student object. This doesn't make too much of a difference, just another way of achieving the same thing;
    3. I decided to 'overload' the moveOut method so that it accepts a student's name instead of a Student object. Same as 2;
    4. In order to make the two overload methods in 2 and 3 run without errors, I also overload the constructor of Student so that it can accepts only a name.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
