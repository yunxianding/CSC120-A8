- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For **House.java**:
    1. I decided to `overload` the moveIn method so that it accepts arrayList of students. This makes moving in multiple students easier;
    2. I decided to `overload` the moveOut method so that it accepts arrayList of students. This makes moving out multiple students easier;

For **Library.java**:
    1. I decided to `overload` the addTitle method so that we can add multiple titles as once. This is because it makes adding much easier if we are trying add a lot of books;
    2. I decided to `overload` the removeTitle method so that we can remove multiple titles as once. Same as 2.

For **Cafe.java**:
    1. I decided to `overload` the sellCoffee method and set for default coffee formula. This is because it makes easier if customers just want a regular cup of coffee and we don't need to write out the ingredients again.
    2. I decided to `overload` the restock method and set for default restock size. This makes it easier to restock.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I'm confused about why I got grading comments that program doesn't compile. I would love more feedback about that!
I forgot the difference between 'override' and 'overload' easily. So I decided to write the definitions here again to remind myself.
**Override**ï¼šmodify or replace an inherited method
**Overload**: define muliple versions of the same method to accommodate different type/number of parameters
I would suggest people to keep a notebook and writes down similar definitions that might confuse you so that you can refer to whenever unsure.
